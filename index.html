			At <a href="http://voorhoede.nl" target="_blank">de Voorhoede</a> we
			keep a close eye on the latest new web standards and technologies.
			Every now and then we organize in-house workshops to experiment with
			these new features. During our our workshop '3D in the browser' we
			we're introduced to the latest developments in 3D technology used on
			the web, the current state and browser support. We then divided into
			two teams which both managed to develop a working 3D model in the
			browser in just 3 hours. Coincidentally both using our Voorhoede logo
			as their starting point.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this post you'll find the results of our experiment with a short
			description of each team's process:

		<h2>Introducing 3D in the browser</h2>
		<p>
			Arend, the latest addition to our developers team, is a 3D / CAD / CAM
			savvy developer. So who better to show us around in the possibilities
			of 3D in the browser? Arend introduces the team into
			<q cite="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/webgl/"><a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/" target="_blank">
				WebGL</a>, a new web technology that brings hardware-accelerated
				3D graphics to the browser without installing additional software
			</q>.
			The popularity of WebGL is increasing and <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=svg" target="_blank">
			most features are widely support in modern browsers</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To show just how powerful WebGL is Arend presents a few teasing examples:
			<a href="http://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/" target="_blank">WebGL Water</a>,
			<a href="http://polycraftgame.com/" target="_blank">Polycraft Game</a>,
			<a href="http://www.simlab-soft.com/Downloads/WebGL/Shelve_demo.html" target="_blank">Shelves with material picker</a> and
			<a href="http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/" target="_blank">Epic Citadel powered by the Unreal Engine</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To enable developers to quickly work with 3D in the browser, Arend
			suggests a few frameworks:
			<a href="http://threejs.org/" target="_blank">three.js</a>,
			<a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/" target="_blank">Babylon.js</a>,
			<a href="https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/#readme" target="_blank">Processing.js</a>,
			<a href="http://www.voodoojs.com/" target="_blank">Voodoo.js</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a bonus, our special guest <a href="http://dap3.nl/" target="_blank">Sander</a>,
			did a short demonstration of the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/" target="_blank">
			LeapMotion</a>, an advanced motion sensor enabling gesture input using
			up to 4 hands, which even works in the browser, for instance with three.js.
			Seems like a fantastic topic for our next experiments workshop.

		<h2>Result team blue: Shield</h2>
		<p>
			Team blue - Jasper, Sander & Thadee - translated the Voorhoede logo
			into a materialized 3D object, which they then added in a 3D scene
			with lighting, shadows and animations.
		</p>
		<figure class="preview-3d">

		</figure>
		<p>
			To create the 3D model the team imported the <a href="https://github.com/voorhoede/logo-using-font/tree/gh-pages/source" target="_blank">
			Voorhoede logo as vector file</a> into the <a href="http://www.rhino3d.com/" target="_blank">
			Rhino 3D</a> modeling software. The imported curves were then extruded
			and manipulated to create the geometry of the 3D logo shield. The
			logo colors were added using object materials rather than layer materials
			to ensure these are included in the export to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file" target="_blank">
			obj format.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			To render and control the 3D logo shield in the browser, the team
			leverages the browsers' WebGL capability, using the <a href="http://threejs.org/" target="_blank">
			three.js library</a>. The result is based on the <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/r58/examples/webgl_loader_obj.html" target="_blank">
			obj loader example</a> and replaces the default model by the <a href="https://github.com/voorhoede/3d-logo/blob/gh-pages/shield/models/logo.obj" target="_blank">
			obj model of the 3D logo shield</a>. The colors are added by using the
			<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/r58/examples/webgl_loader_obj_mtl.html#L87">
			mtl material loader</a>. Transparency is added to the 'V emblem' by
			directly editing the diffusion value in the <a href="https://github.com/voorhoede/3d-logo/blob/gh-pages/shield/models/logo.mtl#L23" target="_blank">
			exported mtl file</a>. For lighting the team added a hemisphere and
			directional light, simulating a sunny day. Adding shadows and animating
			individual parts of the appeared more difficult. The light's castShadow
			and ground surface receiveShadow properties were set to true. However
			no shadows were rendered yet. The 3D model loaded into the scene was
			actually a group in which the invidual parts of the shield were nested.
			<a href="https://github.com/voorhoede/3d-logo/blob/gh-pages/shield/index.js#L87">
			By iterating through these children their shadow properties could also
			be enabled</a>.  Finally these children - the left and right side of the
			shield and the emblem - could also be <a href="https://github.com/voorhoede/3d-logo/blob/gh-pages/shield/index.js#L151" target="_blank">
			animated in a sequence</a> by manipulating their position and rotation
			using <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/" target="_blank">
			requestAnimationFrame</a>.

		<h2>Result team red: Knight</h2>
		<p>
			Team red - Arend, Jeroen, Sanne - transformed an existing 3D model and
			scene of an average male into a knight equipped with a sword and the
			Voorhoede logo as a shield.

		<p>
			Rather than starting from scratch, this team imported the three.js example
			of the <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/r58/examples/webgl_loader_obj_mtl.html#L87" target="_blank">
			materialized 3D model of an average male</a> and added a sword and shield
			to the model. Just like the blue team, this team added colors to the
			model using object materials and exported the model to an obj & mtl file.
		</p>
		<p>
			The examples used by both teams include a pointer listener enabling you
			to tumble around the 3D model, so don't forget to try that out.
